# Nekoproc

This repo will contain the implementation of Algorithms and Problem set from different platform.

Initially all the source files  will be in C++23, but Lua version will be added.

It'll contain solution from Project Euler , CSES, Advent of Code. Many useful and usage generic Algorithms will be gradully added.

## What is this conding convention ? 

IDK My cat writes them as the name suggest ( Neko = cat, proc : produced )

## Why C++ and Lua ?

There's no better programming lanugage other than C++ for implementing Algorithms. It has THE best standard Libary for this task and It's fast... only the programmer is the limit.

And Lua is fun to write . Many algorithms use Regex and I think Lua is better than C++ when it's comes to Regex, the <regex> sucks and it's so slow.
Also writing programms in Lua is fun apparently ( My cat said )

## Your cat talks ?

Yes... also teaches me the ways.
